BRANCH

//git branch (by click this command it will dispaly list of branch & we also use this command to check the whether the branch is created or not)
//git branch branchname( this command is used to create the new branch)
//git checkout branchname (this command is used for to switch to another branch)& (by using the same command we can change branch for which particular branch we need to go)pp

note : what ever the data created in exiting branch it will not be in other branch 
if we want the data which we created in exiting file to our new branch then we need to use the command:
*** but we should be in branch the data need to come
//git merge branchname
//git branch -d branchname (if we need to delete the branch we should not be in that branch to delete the BN)
// git push origin branch-name(or) git push path/c-repo branch-name (used to push our branch which is present in localrepo  to cental repo)
>>>> note :we are doing push for paticular we no need to be in that branch or we may be in that branch it dependences upon our wish.>>>>
note :
if want to merge the branch like if we are in main then we merge releasebranch1 in the main branch then we to use the command
//git merge branchname 
>>>>>> need click esc :wq!
//git push 
// git push -d branchname  (used to delete branch name in local)
//git push origin -d branchname(used to delete branchname in centralrepo)

note: if we are in other repo then we hit (git branch) then it will display only the main branch only. if we enter below command the it will show all branches
// git branch -r (this command is used to show the remote branch)
// git branch -a (this command will both in local in remote branch will display)

//git cherry-pick cid (this command is used to merge only some particular file of data to another branch then this command is used)
// cat filename (it will display the content present inside our file )
//git checkout -b branchname (by using this command it will create new branch and & wil automatically enter in that new branch)
